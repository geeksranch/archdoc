# Phase D: Technology Architecture

## Overview

Phase D defines the technology architecture that will support the data and application architectures defined in Phase C. This phase covers infrastructure, networking, and security components for the hybrid cloud environment.

## Objectives

- Define the hybrid cloud infrastructure architecture
- Design the network topology and connectivity
- Establish the security architecture and controls
- Document technology standards and patterns

## Documents in This Phase

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md) | Multi-cloud and on-premises infrastructure |
| [Network Architecture](network-architecture.md) | Network topology and connectivity |
| [Security Architecture](security-architecture.md) | Security layers and controls |

## Key Deliverables

1. **Infrastructure Architecture** - Compute, storage, and platform services
2. **Network Architecture** - VPCs, subnets, and connectivity
3. **Security Architecture** - Identity, access, and threat protection
4. **Technology Standards** - Approved technologies and versions

## Technology Domains

| Domain | Description | Key Components |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Compute** | Processing capacity | GKE, Compute Engine, Cloud Run |
| **Storage** | Data persistence | Cloud Storage, Persistent Disks |
| **Network** | Connectivity | VPC, Cloud Interconnect, VPN |
| **Security** | Protection controls | IAM, VPC-SC, Cloud Armor |
| **Operations** | Management tools | Cloud Monitoring, Logging |

## Architecture Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hybrid by Design** | Seamless integration between cloud and on-premises |
| **Security First** | Security embedded in all layers |
| **Automation** | Infrastructure as Code for consistency |
| **Resilience** | High availability and disaster recovery |
| **Cost Optimization** | Right-sizing and efficient resource use |
