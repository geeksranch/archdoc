# Phase C: Information Systems Architecture

## Overview

Phase C defines the information systems architecture, encompassing both data architecture and application architecture. This phase establishes how data flows through the organization and how applications are structured to support business capabilities.

## Objectives

- Define the target data architecture for hybrid cloud
- Design the application architecture patterns
- Establish data governance and quality standards
- Define integration patterns between systems

## Documents in This Phase

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Data Architecture](data-architecture.md) | Data flow, storage, and governance |
| [Application Architecture](application-architecture.md) | Application landscape and patterns |

## Key Deliverables

1. **Data Architecture Model** - Data entities, flows, and storage
2. **Application Architecture Model** - Application components and interactions
3. **Data Governance Framework** - Policies and standards for data management
4. **Integration Specifications** - APIs and integration patterns

## Architecture Principles

### Data Architecture Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data as an Asset** | Treat data as a valuable business asset |
| **Single Source of Truth** | Maintain authoritative data sources |
| **Data Quality** | Ensure accuracy, completeness, and timeliness |
| **Data Security** | Protect data based on classification |
| **Data Accessibility** | Enable appropriate access to data |

### Application Architecture Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Microservices** | Decompose into independently deployable services |
| **API-First** | Design APIs before implementation |
| **Cloud-Native** | Build for cloud scalability and resilience |
| **Containerization** | Package applications in containers |
| **Statelessness** | Design stateless services where possible |
